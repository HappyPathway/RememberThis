All People, even sad people, are usually actually pretty happy. Sometimes
people forget that their happy. Sometimes people forget that the things they're
chasing after really aren't that important. The love and the magic that could be
right there in front of them, if they'd take the time to notice, is all that they
really need. Sometimes they just need to be reminded...

Sometimes, people in relationships go through tough times. Sometimes
two people in a relationship have a hard time remembering all of the 
magic in the relationship. Sometimes they forget how much love they've shared.
Sometimes they just need to be reminded...

This App will allow two users to share a pool of pictures, with the App sending 
the same picture to both parties. I'm hoping this will spark conversations between
the two people, helping them to remember all of the love and all of the magic in 
their life, reminding people to SUMO and be happy. Remember This!
